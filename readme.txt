== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How am I billed for the carbon offsets? =

Whether you or your customer pays for the offset itself, you have to set up a subscription on our website and you'll be charged on your chosen billing cycle.

Why do we do this? We have payment processing fees and by using a subscription model, we can maximise the climate projects we fund. Otherwise, every transaction will have a 20&cent;/25p transaction fee on top of the offset itself. This keeps the cost down for you or your customer.

= Where does the money go? =

This changes all the time, but with our partners we prioritise funding the most efficient and beneficial projects. This could range anywhere between planting mangroves in Madagascar and local planting and conservation.
